# Tableau E-commerce Dashboard Project

This project showcases a Tableau dashboard that visualizes product data from a simulated e-commerce store, fetched using the Fake Store API. The dashboard includes various analyses like product distribution, price distribution, and product count by category.

## Files in this Repository
- **`fetchapi.py`**: A Python script that fetches and processes data from the Fake Store API.
- **`products.csv`**: A sample CSV file with product data used for analysis.
- **`_E-commerce Product Analysis: Distribution and Pricing_.twbx`**: The Tableau Packaged Workbook containing the interactive dashboard.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Run the Python script `fetchapi.py` to fetch the product data (or use the provided `products.csv` file).
3. Open the Tableau workbook (`_E-commerce Product Analysis: Distribution and Pricing_.twbx`) using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public to explore the dashboard.

## Dashboard Features
- Product Distribution by Category
- Average Price by Product Category
- Total Price by Product Category
- Price Distribution by Product Category
- Product Count by Category

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **Fake Store API**: Provides simulated e-commerce data.
- **Python**: Used for data processing and manipulation.
- **CSV File**: Static data used as an alternative to the API.

## Future Improvements
- Add more advanced data cleaning and transformation to the Python script.
- Enhance the Tableau dashboard with additional metrics, like customer feedback or ratings (if available).
- Implement interactive filter actions for more granular insights.
